    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example, since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. I'm sure you have seen this before somewhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "![http-basic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnUZW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many REST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar concept common used by many APIs is to assign API Keys to each client that needs access to server resources. The client must then pass the API Key along with _every_ request it makes to the API to authenticate. This is because the server is typically relatively stateless and does not maintain a session between subsequent calls from the same client. Most APIs (including Yelp) allow you to pass the API Key via a special HTTP Header: \"Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>\". Check out the [docs](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication) for more information.\n",
    "\n",

I did [kinda] well the first 6 weeks....Then one night, I was watching The Food Network and a pastry competition came on. I don\\'t even care for pastries but all of a sudden, I had an urge to smash through every pastry case in the city and inhale croissants, danishes, strudels, tarts, pies, and any carblicious thing I could get my grubby hands on.Orange is not the new black for me so I decided I would just try to stick with healthier carbs instead of a full on restriction. But, what the hell do you do when you\\'re craving pizza? Wheat crust is whacked and cauliflower crust makes my arse sing. This is where Pinsa comes in...If you\\'re watching your carbs too but crave pizza, look no further than Gusto Pinsa Romana!Opening last Saturday, Gusto is the third Pinseria to open in the SF Bay Area serving Roman-style flatbreads that are a great healthy alternative to pizza without sacrificing the taste and texture of the real deal. It\\'s lower in carbs, sugar, fat, and calories and it\\'s highly digestible so it won\\'t spike your blood sugar (no food coma afterwards!): bit.ly/2EgP2Sq. Vegetarian and vegan friendly (they have vegan cheese!). Cafe by morning, Gusto starts serving pinsas at 11 am. It\\'s great if you can make it out there for lunch because it\\'s a small space and once word gets out, Gusto is going to be packed!I ordered the Montanara Pinsa w/ mozzarella, pecorino, guanciale, mushroom, truffle oil, black pepper, and parsley ($18) which was deliciously satisfying: bit.ly/2SG0I56.The pinsa crust is crisp, perfectly light, nicely chewy, and flavorful from the truffle oil: bit.ly/2EtjHgo.The melty cheese was fresh and stretchy, and the crispy guanciale added a tasty pork richness without an overwhelming saltiness (ahem bacon or pancetta). If you like heat, there\\'s a chili pepper grinder on the table to doctor up your pinsa. I ate half of my pinsa and was full so it\\'s a perfect meal for two with a side salad. Service was incredibly warm, friendly, and customer oriented. My server, Daniel was awesome, as well as, the other staff I chatted with. The owner (?) told me the little touches they use that make their pinsa different from Montesacro off 6th street. They make great pinsa too but the service is like night and day compared to Gusto.While the space is small, the owner(s) have done an amazing job transforming the former Cybelle\\'s Pizza space. It\\'s now bright and modern with a beautiful espresso/wine bar and motif tiles. I was also jocking their restroom wallpaper. There\\'s seating for 14 inside and two dog-friendly tables outside (hooray!).  As a neighborhood restaurant, Gusto is the perfect package - delicious pinsa, fantastic service, and gorgeous, cozy space! Too bad I live at the other end of SF, otherwise Tater Tot and I would be regular customers at Gusto. I\\'m sure my wallet (and thunder thighs) is happy though...'}, {'review_id': 'oZuP5zeHVKJ2gohyJ8lCzQ', 'user_id': 'oJMAlaZ5iSzw9d2IfgqnOA', 'rating': '4.0', 'date': '1/27/2019', 'text': 'Gusto Pinsa Romana offers a cozy, lovely ambiance for an enjoyable pizza experience. The pizza tastes great for its notable fluffiness of its crust (almost bread-y) and the wealth of cheese on it. We tried the classic margarita pizza and the tropea pizza which had anchovies, zucchini, and capers. While the balance of cheese, crust, and vegetables across our pizzas put smiles on our faces, as a tomato-sauce lover I would have liked he red sauced pizzas to balance that savory taste in the pizzas. A bottle of red blend wine, 1448, complemented the pizzas perfectly with its peppery Tempranillo-like quality without too much tannins.Gusto Pinsa is tucked away in a narrow slice of building and seems to only accommodate no more than 20 people. The staff attentively ensured we received our meal quickly and asked us several times how we were enjoying our meal. We were even told if we were waiting for another guest we should go ahead an order because the pizza could take a while to make - though it came out so quickly that we actually felt rushed to free up space in the establishment.All in all, Gusto Pinsa Romano satisfies the classic pizza urges that so many people no doubt have.'}, {'review_id': 'Ms3erTZX5qVbkBrvxrMYKg', 'user_id': '7aIdnWESjTanCBZtpGcQWA', 'rating': '5.0', 'date': '1/9/2019', 'text': \"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.

Omg it's so delicious, airy and crispy at the same time. I am not usually a crust person, but I could eat this just as plain bread. That is how good it is. On top of all the delicious flavor, the crust is healthier than other pizzas! 48% less sugar, 85% less fat, 100% less cholesterol, 33% less calories. Talk about a dream come true!

I'd say the only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars was mostly because the wait time for two takeout pizzas was quite awhile, but this is presumably because they had a rush of dine-in customers pop up around the same time as I'd ordered. Also, I was super bummed after walking home to see that the mushrooms I'd requested to add to my marinara pizza were totally absent.

I love the decor inside very clean & Roman looking. Beautiful kitchen you can see the cooks preparing your Pinsa as you watch.We started with the prosciutto e pera salad. It's a bed of arugula topped with prosciutto and thinly sliced pears along with gorgonzola cheese & walnuts with a balsamic vinegar dressing. The flavors were delicious & light to start. Then we were onto try the pinsa. I was talking with one of the cooks who works here & came over from Italy. He was telling me about the Pinsa dough he said it's typical Roman food but it's very hard to find a place even in Italy that makes the Pinsa dough correctly. It takes 48-72 hours to rise and most restaurants want it faster so they don't allow it the proper amount of time to rise. Here he is the one making the pinsa. He said allowing it to rise is worth it because it changes the flavor completely. Pinsa tastes so much different than pizza. I normally do not like the crust but this crust was amazing. It's nice and crispy on the outside but smooth on the inside. We tried the Parma, Quattro formaggi & Triple P pinsa's. I loved each one for different reasons. The Parma has amazing buffalo mozzarella that is so creamy & salty I wanted to eat just that with bread. The Quattro Formaggi was amazing because if you're a cheese lover... it has four different types of cheese and the flavors are amazing. The triple P has potatoes thinly sliced, pesto & crispy prosciutto, flavors that I had never tried before but were super good!! We got a cannoli to finish with chocolate and cherries on it. The cannoli was super crispy and flavorful & the cream was amazing! We got two pastries to go to try out in the morning. (They are a pastry & coffee shop by morning & pinsa at night). They have a full espresso bar and tons of fresh pastries available for purchase. This spot was full when we came. But it was a quick wait. You can also order your food to go. One of the owners is a good friend of mine. She & her family are running the business. They are a very kind & hospitable family. I love that this is a family owned business.

I thought the pinsas were all solid, but I assumed there would be fresh mozzarella used for the cheese (which is fairly standard for margherita pizzas). However, it seemed like the cheese was made from a different form of mozzarella (perhaps shredded?). The other slight disappointment was the margherita pizza had very little sauce. The lack of sauce meant that the cheese was a bit overwhelming.Overall, I enjoyed this place and think its a great addition to San Francisco.

    "Using `requests`, programmatically retrieve __ALL__ of the reviews for a __single__ restaurant (provided as a parameter). Just like the API was paginated, the HTML paginates its reviews (it would be a very long web page to show 300 reviews on a single page) and to get all the reviews you will need to parse and traverse the HTML. As input your function will receive a URL corresponding to a Yelp restaurant. As output return a list of dictionaries (structured the same as question 3) containing the relevant information from the reviews.\n",

    "    'text': \"I've only had the pizza at the Porch, so this 4 stars is for the pizza! This is a great place to come, especially for their late-night half-off pizza special during the weekdays. I've looked at their non-pizza menu and it's a bit pricey, but from what other people tell me, the other food is great. The pizza is more than large enough to feed one person, but my friends and I usually split a couple between us so we can have different flavors. My favorites is the Piggie Pie, but I also had another seasonal pizza with goat cheese and fig on it, which was also extremely good! The crust is nice and crunchy on the outside, but soft enough on the inside, and the ratio of sauce-to-crust is perfect. Overall, this is a fabulous spot to come to if you're a student in Oakland looking for a late-night snack, or a non-student who wants a classier spot to eat at in Oakland. Will be back again!\", \n",
